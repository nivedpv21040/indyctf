In this question we are given two audio file ciphertext and key ,first I decode the audio using morse code(https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) ,and we get cipher text as 'Q O V W X N G C M N Q E C U I I A T" ,key as"COOPER"after that we need to open the link in hint and we need to go to Beaufort Cipher and enter ciphertext and key after that the result will be our flag.
